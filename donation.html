        <p>Sea turtles may survive in the ocean without access to freshwater. 
            They consume enough water and process seawater to meet their needs. Sea turtles have a salt gland to get rid of extra salt in their 
            body, just as other marine reptiles and seabirds. The sea turtles' eyes get the contents of this gland.</p>
        <br>
<p>Our project helps to safeguard four turtle species. Leatherback, green, loggerhead, and highly endangered hawksbill turtles nest on the 
    island's beaches. Volunteers patrol the nesting areas to prevent poaching, assist hatchling turtles in reaching the sea, and clear 
    damaging waste from the region. Local women have formed a business "upcycling" waste nets and sails into goods such as tote bags thanks to a Seacology award. The products have been
     well received by both visitors and local university students.</p><br>
