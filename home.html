               <h1>TURTLES</h1>
    <p>Our ocean waters are home to seven distinct species of sea (or marine) turtles, from the shallow seagrass meadows of the Indian Ocean to 
        the vibrant coral reefs of the Coral Triangle and the sandy beaches of the Eastern Pacific. Sea turtles spend the majority of their lives 
        in the ocean, even though these highly migratory animals occasionally go on land to either bask or lay their eggs. Green, hawksbill,
         loggerhead, leatherback, and olive ridley sea turtles are the five species on which WWF focuses its sea turtle efforts.Human actions have
          shifted the odds against these historic mariners' survival during the past 200 years. Sea turtles are victimized by poaching and 
          over-exploitation as they are slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin, and shells. They also face bycatch, or unintentional capture in
           fishing gear, and habitat loss.

        <p>In the shallow offshore seas, turtles mate primarily during the day. Others mating on the water's surface, while some turtles do so underwater. To grasp the female securely while mating, adult male turtles have strong claws. During the mating season, one female can have multiple matings with different males and store the sperm in her body. A single clutch may contain eggs that were fertilized by multiple guys since these stored sperm are used to fertilize eggs. After finding the nesting location, the female waits until dusk in the shallow waters near the shore. Because it is cooler and less visible to huge predators at night, female turtles choose to lay their eggs there.</p><br>

        <p>Under the stars and the moon, sea turtles frequently lay their eggs at night. No risk of burning in the sun and fewer predators on the beach at night are only two benefits of nocturnal nesting.Her flippers, which are typically used for swimming, push and pull the hefty body of the female sea turtle across the sand as she pushes herself up onto the shore. After then, the other flipper advances</p><br>
