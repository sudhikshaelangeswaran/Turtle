        <h1>KOSGODA</h1>
        <br>
        <P>
            Six of the seven species of sea turtles are now considered to be endangered. Additionally, a large portion of it is a result of human 
            exploitation of natural resources. Thankfully, this hatchery has accepted the responsibility to safeguard them. They begin by keeping an 
            eye on the nesting mother turtles, transporting their eggs to the safe environment of the hatchery, and then, on the day the baby turtles 
            are born, releasing them into the sea. If there are problems, they tend to them and only let them go into the great ocean after they are 
            well enough to do so.All five of the nation's species have their nests in Kosgoda, one of the very few hatcheries where this is possible.
             These include the Olive Ridley, Leatherback, Green, Loggerhead, and Hawksbill turtles.

        <p>The Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery is an excellent spot to see the endangered turtles that visit Sri Lanka. The hatchery protects turtle eggs and
             damaged turtles by rehabilitating them. To conserve the turtle population that visits the coastlines to nest, the hatchery gathers and stores the eggs until they are ready to hatch and return to the great blue. You might even get to release some hatchlings back into the water, 
            making it the ideal holistic experience for everybody.</p>

                <p>Reburied in the hatchery, where they can safely hatch, are eggs that have been taken from nests on the seashore or even purchased from poachers to avoid their sale in the markets. Hatchlings should never be released during the daytime, thus the majority are released as soon as possible at night. However, some are held back for a brief time to give them a "headstart" until they are stronger.

There has been construction work done.As significant as the project is, it is a part of a small town, and only a community working together can accomplish the project's conservation objectives. Turtles and the most extraordinary and tough people can be found in Kosgoda.
